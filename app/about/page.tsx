                <p>
                  Trevor and Katie Wilson were part of Belfast City Vineyard Church for many years, where they were both
                  part of the leadership team and Katie was Children's Pastor. They always had a dream in their hearts
                  to church plant and a couple of years ago they felt God was calling them to somewhere new.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Through a number of dreams and prophetic words it became clear that God was speaking about planting a
                  new Vineyard church in Comber. They gathered a team, who began to meet and pray in 2024 and in Autumn
                  2025, Faith Vineyard Church began!
                </p>

                <p>
                  We believe God has something amazing for the Comber area and we just can't wait to be part of what He
                  is doing there. We want to be a relaxed, friendly place where everyone from the youngest to the oldest
                  gets to play! We want to be a church family that actually feels like family. We long to see faith grow
                  amongst the people here and we would love you to be part of our story!

                  To help us live a life of faith we want to prioritise spending time with God and finding people to
                  come alongside and walk through life with. We are a multigenerational family where everybody gets to
                  play. We want to do life together in a way that allows us all to grow in faith as we centre our lives
                  around what Jesus has done for us. Faith Vineyard is a place where we want to grow in faith as we meet
                  together, have fun together, pray for and speak life over each other. We prioritise being in God's
                  presence and word together. We want to be a place where people can be truly themselves whatever the
                  season and discover what they are made for. We want to love God in a way that makes an impact as we
                  meet people in the everyday activities of life, serving in a way that makes God visible and inviting
                  new friends to gather round the table as part of our family of faith.
